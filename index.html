    <h2>WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MUSIC STUDIO</h2>
     </section>
     <p>For most people, the first time stepping into a professional music studio is a moment nothing short of magical. And for most, it never stops feeling that way. The image of the engineer adjusting levels on the boards, audio techs setting up mics, the pressing silence of the sound baffles in the recording booths. All of it adds up to a place where the magic of music happens.<br> Working in or running a music studio requires in-depth knowledge of a great many things and passable knowledge of a few others. Here’s an expanded view of what you’ll find in a music studio.

        THINGS YOU'LL FIND IN THE MUSIC STUDIO
    </h3>    
   
    <li>
            The Equpment:
            <p>
                A well-equipped music studio is filled with machines, some of which have an obvious purpose, and others, less so. <br> The producer’s booth, often referred to as the control room, will house a large central mixing console will have a large number of channels, typically at least twenty but as many as seventy, in order to effectively accommodate a number of performers and instruments simultaneously. There will also be smaller mixing consoles ranging from six to twenty channels that may be used to record instrumentation in the isolation booths.

        The Staff in a Music Studio:
        <p>
            All kinds of different professionals work in a music studio, and only some of them are necessarily music professionals. <br> To start with, there’s the studio manager. The studio manager oversees the day to day operations of the studio, much as a manager might in a retail store. They oversee maintenance, payment, payroll, and oftentimes booking (although in larger studios, these may be two separate roles).
